-- doesn't work, as command appears as "raft", not "blpop"
Blocking command accounted only once in commandstats after timeout

-- Streams not supported
-- See: https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft/issues/59
/.*XREAD.*
/.*XADD.*
/.*XRANGE.*
COPY basic usage for stream
COPY basic usage for stream-cgroups
Keyspace notifications: stream events test
lazy free a stream with all types of metadata
lazy free a stream with deleted cgroup
-- depends on streams
Blocking commands ignores the timeout

-- Timeouts and termination of Lua scripts is not possible when scripts are
-- replicated and executed by individual nodes.
/.*SCRIPT KILL.*
Timedout script does not cause a false dead client
Timedout script link is still usable after Lua returns
/function kill
/script kill
/test wrong subcommand

-- RAFT command prefix shows up in SLOWLOG.
SLOWLOG - Rewritten commands are logged as their original command
SLOWLOG - blocking command is reported only after unblocked

-- RAFT command prefix shows up in MONITOR
MONITOR can log executed commands
MONITOR can log commands issued by the scripting engine
MONITOR can log commands issued by functions
MONITOR correctly handles multi-exec cases
MONITOR log blocked command only once

-- TODO: check what's wrong
UNLINK can reclaim memory in background

-- ACL test fails because we prepend "raft" string to the command
Script ACL check

-- WATCH (multi/exec) not supported
/.*MULTI.*
/.*EXEC.*
/.*WATCH.*
SMOVE only notify dstset when the addition is successful
FLUSHALL is able to touch the watched keys
FLUSHDB is able to touch the watched keys
client evicted due to watched key list
FLUSHALL does not touch non affected keys
FLUSHDB does not touch non affected keys
SWAPDB is able to touch the watched keys that exist
SWAPDB is able to touch the watched keys that do not exist

-- After fixing this: https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft/issues/367
-- We don't need to skip this test as it doesn't actually configure a replica.
not enough good replicas

-- We can't handle normal plain eval (without flags) the same way as redis aborting oom on demand
Consistent eval error reporting


-- These three tests were introduced by https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12326
-- Probably, it needs a fix to make them work when commands are executed via RM_Call()
-- See related ticket: https://redislabs.atlassian.net/browse/RR-323
