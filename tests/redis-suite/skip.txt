-- Blocking commands not supported
BLPOP with variadic LPUSH

.*B[RL]POP.*
.*B[RLZ]MPOP.*
.*BLMOVE.*
.*B[LR]POP.*
.*BZM?POP_?MIN.*

LPOP/RPOP/LMPOP NON-BLOCK or BLOCK against non list value

-- Streams not supported
-- See: https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft/issues/59
.*XREAD.*
.*XADD.*
.*XRANGE.*
COPY basic usage for stream
Keyspace notifications: stream events test
lazy free a stream with all types of metadata
lazy free a stream with deleted cgroup

-- Timeouts and termination of Lua scripts is not possible when scripts are
-- replicated and executed by individual nodes.
.*SCRIPT KILL.*
Blocking commands ignores the timeout
Timedout script does not cause a false dead client
Timedout script link is still usable after Lua returns
test function kill
test function kill not working on eval
test script kill not working on function
test wrong subcommand

-- RAFT command prefix shows up in SLOWLOG.
SLOWLOG - Rewritten commands are logged as their original command

-- RAFT command prefix shows up in MONITOR
MONITOR can log executed commands
MONITOR can log commands issued by the scripting engine
MONITOR correctly handles multi-exec cases

-- TODO: check what's wrong
UNLINK can reclaim memory in background

-- TODO: fix maxmemory config replication and set deny-oom flag for write
--       "raft" commands
Script - disallow write on OOM
FUNCTION - verify OOM on function load and function restore
FUNCTION - deny oom
FUNCTION - deny oom on no-writes function
allow-oom shebang flag
reject script do not cause a Lua stack leak

-- ACL test fails because we prepend "raft" string to the command
Script ACL check

-- Blocked clients not supported
Test read commands are not blocked by client pause
Test write commands are paused by RO

-- WATCH (multi/exec) not supported
.*MULTI.*
.*EXEC.*
.*WATCH.*
SMOVE only notify dstset when the addition is successful
FLUSHALL is able to touch the watched keys
FLUSHDB is able to touch the watched keys
client evicted due to watched key list
FLUSHALL does not touch non affected keys
FLUSHDB does not touch non affected keys
SWAPDB is able to touch the watched keys that exist
SWAPDB is able to touch the watched keys that do not exist
