-- doesn't work, as command appears as "raft", not the comand
Blocking command accounted only once in commandstats after timeout
command stats for MULTI

-- Streams not supported
-- See: https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft/issues/59
/.*XREAD.*
/.*XADD.*
/.*XRANGE.*
COPY basic usage for stream
COPY basic usage for stream-cgroups
Keyspace notifications: stream events test
lazy free a stream with all types of metadata
lazy free a stream with deleted cgroup
-- depends on streams
Blocking commands ignores the timeout

-- Timeouts and termination of Lua scripts is not possible when scripts are
-- replicated and executed by individual nodes.
/.*SCRIPT KILL.*
Timedout script does not cause a false dead client
Timedout script link is still usable after Lua returns
/function kill
/script kill
/test wrong subcommand
/.*script timeout.*

-- RAFT command prefix shows up in SLOWLOG.
SLOWLOG - Rewritten commands are logged as their original command
SLOWLOG - blocking command is reported only after unblocked

-- RAFT command prefix shows up in MONITOR
MONITOR can log executed commands
MONITOR can log commands issued by the scripting engine
MONITOR can log commands issued by functions
MONITOR correctly handles multi-exec cases

-- TODO: check what's wrong
UNLINK can reclaim memory in background

-- ACL test fails because we prepend "raft" string to the command
Script ACL check

-- MULTI/EXEC is currently read-write in RedisRaft 
EXEC with only read commands should not be rejected when OOM

-- SAVE is in general unsupported in RedisRaft so can ignore it in multi as well
MULTI with SAVE

-- After fixing this: https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft/issues/367
-- We don't need to skip this test as it doesn't actually configure a replica.
not enough good replicas

-- We can't handle normal plain eval (without flags) the same way as redis aborting oom on demand
Consistent eval error reporting
