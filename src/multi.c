/* Handle MULTI/EXEC transactions here.
 *
 * We want to make sure that the commands are executed atomically across all
 * cluster nodes. To do this, we need to pack them as a single Raft log entry.
 *
 * If this logic was applied, the return value is true, indicating no further
 * processing is required.
 *
 * 1) On MULTI, we create a RaftRedisCommandArray which will store all
 *    user commands as they are queued.
 * 2) On EXEC, we move all queued commands from multi_client_state and place
 *    them in the command array and let the rest of the code handle it.
 * 3) On DISCARD we simply remove the queued commands array.
 *
 * Important notes:
 * 1) Although as a module we don't need to pass MULTI to Redis, we still keep
 *    it in the array, because when processing the array we want to distinguish
 *    between a MULTI with a single command and a non-MULTI scenario.
 * 2) If our command array contains multiple commands, we assume it was received
 *    as a RAFT.ENTRY in which case we need to process it as an EXEC. That means
 *    we don't need to reply with +OK and multiple +QUEUED, but just process
 *    the commands atomically.  This is common when a follower proxies a batch
 *    of commands to a leader: the follower handles the user interaction and
 *    the leader only handles the execution (when the user issued the final
 *    EXEC).
 *
 * Error handling rules (derived from Redis):
 * 1) MULTI and DISCARD should always succeed.
 * 2) If we encounter errors inside a MULTI context, we need to flag that
 *    transaction as failed but keep going until EXEC/DISCARD.
 * 3) RAFT related state checks can be postponed and evaluated only at the
 *    time of EXEC.
